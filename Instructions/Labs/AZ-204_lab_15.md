# Lab 15: Implement containerized solutions

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes that occur after the development of this training content. As a result, the lab instructions and lab steps might not align correctly.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community alerts us to needed changes. However, cloud updates occur frequently, so you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab environment

Sign in to your Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) by using the following credentials:

- Username: `Admin`
- Password: `Pa55w.rd`

> **Note**: Your instructor will provide instructions to connect to the virtual lab environment.

#### Review the installed applications

Find the taskbar on your Windows 10 desktop. The taskbar contains the icon for the application that you'll use in this lab:

- Microsoft Edge

## Lab Scenario

In this lab, you will explore how to create and deploy containers to the Container Registry using a .NET application and Docker files.

1. Select **+ Create a resource** in the top left corner of the page.

1. In the search bar, type **Container Registry** and select **Container Registry** from the results.

1. Select **Create**.

1. In the "Basics" tab of the **Create Container Registry** page, fill out the following information:

    | Setting | Action |
    | -- | -- |
    | **Subscription** text box | Retain the default value |
    | **Resource group** section | Select **Create new**, enter **acr-sam-rg**, and then select **OK** |
    | **Registry name** section | enter **acrsam**_[yourname]_ |
    | **Location** drop-down list | Select **East US** |

   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0 AS base
   WORKDIR /app
   EXPOSE 5116

   ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:5116

   # Creates a non-root user with an explicit UID and adds permission to access the /app folder
   # For more info, please refer to https://aka.ms/vscode-docker-dotnet-configure-containers
