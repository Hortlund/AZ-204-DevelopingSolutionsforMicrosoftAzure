# Lab 15: Implement containerized solutions

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes that occur after the development of this training content. As a result, the lab instructions and lab steps might not align correctly.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community alerts us to needed changes. However, cloud updates occur frequently, so you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab environment

Sign in to your Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) by using the following credentials:

- Username: `Admin`
- Password: `Pa55w.rd`

> **Note**: Your instructor will provide instructions to connect to the virtual lab environment.

#### Review the installed applications

Find the taskbar on your Windows 10 desktop. The taskbar contains the icon for the application that you'll use in this lab:

- Microsoft Edge

## Lab Scenario

In this lab, you will explore how to create and deploy containers to the Container Registry using a .NET application and Docker files.

1. At the **Cloud Shell** command prompt in the portal, run the following command to create a variable with a unique value for the Container Registry resource: 

    ```bash
    registryName=conregistry$RANDOM
    ```

1. At the **Cloud Shell** command prompt in the portal, run the following command to verify the name created in the previous step is available: 

    ```bash
    az acr check-name --name $registryName
    ```

    If the results show the name is available, continue to the next step. If the name is not available then re-run the command in the previous step and verify availability again.

1. At the **Cloud Shell** command prompt in the portal, run the following command to create a Container Registry resource: 

    ```bash
    az acr create --resource-group ContainerCompute --name $registryName --sku Basic
    ```

    > **Note**: Wait for the creation task to complete before you continue with this lab.

#### Task 2: Create a Docker file to build a container image

1. Open a text editor on your local machine.

1. Create a new file and name it `Dockerfile`.

 ```docker
    # Use the official .NET Core SDK image as a parent image  
    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.1 AS build-env  
  
    # Set the working directory to /app  
    WORKDIR /app  
  
    # Copy the .csproj file to the working directory  
    COPY *.csproj ./  
  
    # Restore NuGet packages  
    RUN dotnet restore
