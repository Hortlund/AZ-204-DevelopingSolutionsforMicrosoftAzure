# Lab 14: Develop apps for Azure storage

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes that occur after the development of this training content. As a result, the lab instructions and lab steps might not align correctly.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community alerts us to needed changes. However, cloud updates occur frequently, so you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab environment

Sign in to your Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) by using the following credentials:

- Username: `Admin`
- Password: `Pa55w.rd`

> **Note**: Your instructor will provide instructions to connect to the virtual lab environment.

#### Review the installed applications

Find the taskbar on your Windows 10 desktop. The taskbar contains the icon for the application that you'll use in this lab:

- Microsoft Edge

## Lab Scenario

In this lab, you will implement a storage account, a blob container for the images, and secure the storage account using shared access signatures for the customer to access and download their images.
You will also implement an Azure Cosmos DB instance to store customer-related data for billing information. The connection string to the Azure Cosmos DB will be secured using Azure Key Vault. The Azure Functions will use this information to securely access Azure Cosmos DB.
Since there may be multiple orders arriving simultaneously, you will also make use of message queuing to store the order and job information before it is written to the database.
