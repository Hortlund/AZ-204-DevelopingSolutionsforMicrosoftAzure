# Lab 14: Develop apps for Azure storage

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes that occur after the development of this training content. As a result, the lab instructions and lab steps might not align correctly.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community alerts us to needed changes. However, cloud updates occur frequently, so you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab environment

Sign in to your Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) by using the following credentials:

- Username: `Admin`
- Password: `Pa55w.rd`

> **Note**: Your instructor will provide instructions to connect to the virtual lab environment.

#### Review the installed applications

Find the taskbar on your Windows 10 desktop. The taskbar contains the icon for the application that you'll use in this lab:

- Microsoft Edge

## Lab Scenario

In this lab, you will implement a storage account, a blob container for the images, and secure the storage account using shared access signatures for the customer to access and download their images.

You will also implement an Azure Cosmos DB instance to store customer-related data for billing information. The connection string to the Azure Cosmos DB will be secured using Azure Key Vault. The Azure Functions will use this information to securely access Azure Cosmos DB.

Since there may be multiple orders arriving simultaneously, you will also make use of message queuing to store the order and job information before it is written to the database.

    string[] customerInfo = myQueueItem.AsString.Split(',');  
  
    string customerId = customerInfo[0];  
    string customerName = customerInfo[1];  
    string customerEmail = customerInfo[2];  
  
    // Do something with the customer data, such as store it in a database or send an email.  
}  
```

1. Save the changes to the "run.csx" file.

1. Test the function by adding a message to the specified queue in the Azure Storage Account. The message should contain the customer data in the format: **"customerId,customerName,customerEmail"**. The function should be triggered automatically and the customer data should be processed according to the code in the **"run.csx"** file.

#### Task 2: Create an Azure function that writes data from the message queue to the Azure Cosmos DB

1. Open the Azure portal and navigate to the Function App that you want to use.
1. Select on the "Functions" menu item and then click on the "+ New Function" button.
1. Choose "Azure Queue Storage trigger" as the template for the new function.
1. Fill in the required fields, such as the name of the function, the name of the storage account, and the name of the queue.
1. Choose the "C#" language and click on "Create".
1. In the "function.json" file, modify the "connection" property to specify the name of the Azure Storage Account connection string that you want to use.
1. In the "run.csx" file, write the code to read the customer data from the message queue and write it to the Azure Cosmos DB. Here's an example:
#r "Microsoft.Azure.Documents.Client"  
#r "Microsoft.Azure.Documents.Linq"  

```csharp  
using System;  
using System.Linq;  
using Microsoft.Azure.Documents;  
using Microsoft.Azure.Documents.Client;  
using Microsoft.Azure.Documents.Linq;  
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage;  
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Queue;  
  
public static void Run(CloudQueueMessage myQueueItem, TraceWriter log)  
{  
    log.Info($"C# Queue trigger function processed: {myQueueItem.AsString}");  
  
    // Retrieve the customer data from the message body.  
    string[] customerInfo = myQueueItem.AsString.Split(',');  
  
    string customerId = customerInfo[0];  
    string customerName = customerInfo[1];  
    string customerEmail = customerInfo[2];  
  
    // Write the customer data to the Azure Cosmos DB.  
    DocumentClient client = new DocumentClient(new Uri("[cosmos_db_endpoint]"), "[cosmos_db_auth_key]");  
    var collectionUri = UriFactory.CreateDocumentCollectionUri("[cosmos_db_database]", "[cosmos_db_collection]");  
  
    var customer = new  
    {  
        id = customerId,  
        name = customerName,  
        email = customerEmail  
    };  
  
    client.CreateDocumentAsync(collectionUri, customer);  
  
    // Do something else with the customer data, such as send an email or log it.  
}  
``` 

1. Replace "[cosmos_db_endpoint]", "[cosmos_db_auth_key]", "[cosmos_db_database]", and "[cosmos_db_collection]" with the appropriate values for your Azure Cosmos DB account.

1. Save the changes to the "run.csx" file.

1. Test the function by adding a message to the specified queue in the Azure Storage Account. The message should contain the customer data in the format: **"customerId,customerName,customerEmail"**. The function should be triggered automatically and the customer data should be written to the specified Azure Cosmos DB collection.


#### Task 3: Create an Azure function that reads data from the invoicing message queue process

1. Open the Azure portal and navigate to the Function App that you want to use.
1. Select on the "Functions" menu item and then click on the "+ New Function" button.
1. Choose "Azure Queue Storage trigger" as the template for the new function.
1. Fill in the required fields, such as the name of the function, the name of the storage account, and the name of the queue.
1. Choose the "C#" language and click on "Create".
1. In the "function.json" file, modify the "connection" property to specify the name of the Azure Storage Account connection string that you want to use.
1. In the "run.csx" file, write the code to read the invoicing data from the message queue. Here's an example:
#r "Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage"  

```csharp  
using System;  
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage;  
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Queue;  
  
public static void Run(CloudQueueMessage myQueueItem, TraceWriter log)  
{  
    log.Info($"C# Queue trigger function processed: {myQueueItem.AsString}");  
  
    // Retrieve the invoicing data from the message body.  
    string[] invoicingInfo = myQueueItem.AsString.Split(',');  
  
    string customerId = invoicingInfo[0];  
    string jobDetails = invoicingInfo[1];  
  
    // Do something with the invoicing data, such as generate an invoice or log it.  
}  
```
1. Save the changes to the "run.csx" file.

1. Test the function by adding a message to the specified queue in the Azure Storage Account. The message should contain the invoicing data in the format: "customerId,jobDetails". The function should be triggered automatically and the invoicing data should be processed according to the code in the "run.csx" file.


### Task 4: Create an Azure function that sends customer invoice information to a customer via email

1. Open the Azure portal and navigate to the Function App that you created in Task 2.

1. Select on the "Functions" option in the left-hand menu, and then click the "+ Add" button to create a new function.

1. Choose "Event Hub Trigger" as the template for the new function.

1. In the "New Function" dialog box, enter a name for your function, such as "SendInvoiceEmailFunction".

1. Under "Event Hub settings", choose the Event Hub that you created in Task 3.

1. Under "Connection", select "New", and then select "Azure Cosmos DB" from the list of available connections.

1. Enter the name of the Cosmos DB account that you created in Task 3.

1. Under "Input", select "OrderQueue" as the queue that your function will read messages from.

1. Under "Output", select "SendGrid" as the output binding.

1. Enter the SendGrid API key that you created in Task 2.

1. In the "Function code" section, replace the default code with the following code:

```csharp
using System;  
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;  
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;  
using Newtonsoft.Json;  
using SendGrid;  
using SendGrid.Helpers.Mail;  
  
public static async Task Run(string[] eventHubMessages, ILogger log, [CosmosDB(databaseName: "your-db-name", collectionName: "your-collection-name", ConnectionStringSetting = "CosmosDBConnection")]IAsyncCollector<dynamic> documents, [SendGrid()]IAsyncCollector<SendGridMessage> message)  
{  
    foreach (var message in eventHubMessages)  
    {  
        var order = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Order>(message);  
  
        var document = new  
        {  
            id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),  
            customerId = order.CustomerId,  
            jobType = order.JobType,  
            jobCost = order.JobCost,  
            processedDate = DateTime.UtcNow  
        };  
  
        await documents.AddAsync(document);  
  
        var emailMessage = new SendGridMessage();  
        emailMessage.SetFrom(new EmailAddress("your-email-address@example.com", "Contoso Image Processing"));  
        emailMessage.AddTo(new EmailAddress(order.CustomerEmail));  
        emailMessage.SetSubject("Your Contoso Image Processing Invoice");  
        emailMessage.AddContent(MimeType.Text, $"Dear {order.CustomerName},\n\nThank you for using Contoso Image Processing. Your invoice for the {order.JobType} job is {order.JobCost:C}.\n\nBest regards,\nContoso Image Processing");  
  
        await message.AddAsync(emailMessage);  
    }  
}  
  
public class Order  
{  
    public string CustomerId { get; set; }  
    public string CustomerName { get; set; }  
    public string CustomerEmail { get; set; }  
    public string JobType { get; set; }  
    public decimal JobCost { get; set; }  
}  
```

1. Make sure to replace "your-db-name" and "your-collection-name" with the actual names of your Cosmos DB database and collection.

1. Select on the "Save" button to save your function.

1. Test your function by sending a message to the "OrderQueue" queue that you created in Task 3. You can do this by using the Azure Storage Explorer or by using the Azure Portal.

1. Check your email inbox to verify that you received the invoice email.

Congratulations! You have successfully created an Azure function that sends customer invoice information to a customer via email.
